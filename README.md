# Scalar-Implicature-Strength
Term Paper for PHL394K 'Philosophy of Language' - UT Austin Fall 2020

This repository contains the code and report for my term paper on scalar implicature strength. The some-dataset can be downloaded 
[here](https://github.com/thegricean/corpus_some) -- this is the dataset from Degen (2015) on which my analysis and report is 
based. Download the dataset and put it in the `analysis` folder. The `jupyter` and `R` notebooks depend on it. 

Unfortunately, I cannot share the `celex` dataset I used to derive the countability profiles since it is from unpublished work as 
of me writing this. You can obtain a very similar dataset from CELEX2 on [LDC](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96L14/). However, 
code in the notebooks will need to be rewritten for reading data from this dataset.
