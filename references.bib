	abstract = {Relative adjectives in the positive form exhibit vagueness and context-sensitivity. We suggest that these phenomena can be explained by the interaction of a free threshold variable in the meaning of the positive form with a probabilistic model of pragmatic inference. We describe a formal model of utterance interpretation as coordination, which jointly infers the value of the threshold variable and the intended meaning of the sentence. We report simulations exploring the effect of background statistical knowledge on adjective interpretation in this model. Motivated by these simulation results, we suggest that this approach can account for the correlation between scale structure and the relative/absolute distinction while also allowing for exceptions noted in previous work. Finally, we argue for a probabilistic explanation of why the sorites paradox is compelling with relative adjectives even though the second premise is false on a universal interpretation, and show that this account predicts Kennedy’s (2007) observation that the sorites paradox is more compelling with relative than with absolute adjectives.},

	title = {Harnessing the linguistic signal to predict scalar inferences},
	url = {https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.479},
	abstract = {Pragmatic inferences often subtly depend on the presence or absence of linguistic features. For example, the presence of a partitive construction (of the) increases the strength of a so-called scalar inference: listeners perceive the inference that Chris did not eat all of the cookies to be stronger after hearing “Chris ate some of the cookies” than after hearing the same utterance without a partitive, “Chris ate some cookies”. In this work, we explore to what extent neural network sentence encoders can learn to predict the strength of scalar inferences. We first show that an {LSTM}-based sentence encoder trained on an English dataset of human inference strength ratings is able to predict ratings with high accuracy (r = 0.78). We then probe the model's behavior using manually constructed minimal sentence pairs and corpus data. We first that the model inferred previously established associations between linguistic features and inference strength, suggesting that the model learns to use linguistic features to predict pragmatic inferences.},
